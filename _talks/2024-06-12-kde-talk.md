I share my work on my Master Thesis on finding energy inefficiencies in different Linux distributions and libc implementations with the KDE Eco community, focused on improving energy efficiency of software. [Minutes](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/opt-green/-/blob/master/community-meetups/2024-06-12_community-meetup.md), [Slides](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/opt-green/-/blob/master/community-meetups/2024-06-12_presentation_Energy_Inefficiencies_Docker.pdf)

In our experimental work we define a methodology to find inefficiencies in software application, and expose energy inefficiencies in the Alpine C Standard Library compared to Ubuntu.
