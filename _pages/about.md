PhD Student in Computer Science at the Software Engineering Group at TU Delft. I previously finished my Master's in Software Technologies at TU Delft and my Bachelors in Software Engineering at the University of Seville. My research focuses on Sustainable Software Engineering and Green AI and improving the energy efficiency of AI models. I work with [Lu√≠s Cruz](https://luiscruz.github.io/) and the [SELF Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/self-lab) for medical IoT edge devices.

When I'm not working on my PhD, you can find me playing cello with the university student orchestra or playing some games and D&D.
